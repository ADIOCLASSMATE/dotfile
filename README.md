# dotfile

This repository turns the current working shell, tmux, Neovim, Yazi, and baseline Git configuration into a git-managed dotfiles setup that can be replayed on macOS and remote Linux hosts. The local files under `/Users/wjx` were treated as the only source of truth, and secrets or machine-only values were moved out of tracked config.

## Managed files

- `zsh/.zshrc` plus modular `zsh/zshrc.d/*.zsh`
- `tmux/.tmux.conf`
- `git/.gitconfig`
- `nvim/` copied from the active LazyVim config
- `yazi/yazi.toml`
- `install.sh` for bootstrap, package installation, backups, and symlink management

```

`99-private.local.zsh` is generated locally by `./install.sh` from `90-private.example.zsh` if it does not already exist. It is ignored by git.

## Bootstrap

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/dotfile
cd ~/dotfile
./install.sh
```

The installer detects `uname`, creates backups under `~/.dotfile-backups/<timestamp>/`, manages symlinks without GNU Stow, installs tools on a best-effort basis, installs Oh My Zsh if missing, creates `99-private.local.zsh` from the template when needed, and prints a final summary of completed, skipped, and warning items.

The script uses the repository location it is executed from, so it works both for `/Users/wjx/dotfile` on macOS and for any cloned path on Linux.

## Secrets and private values

Tracked files do not contain plaintext credentials, passwords, tokens, server-only directories, or machine-only paths. Put those values in `zsh/zshrc.d/99-private.local.zsh`.

Workflow:

1. Run `./install.sh` once to generate `zsh/zshrc.d/99-private.local.zsh` from the example.
2. Edit `zsh/zshrc.d/99-private.local.zsh` and uncomment or add only the values you need locally.
3. Keep any custom paths such as private tool directories or cluster-only cache locations in that local file.

## Fresh Linux server

On a new Linux host:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/dotfile
cd ~/dotfile
./install.sh
```

Linux behavior:

- If `apt-get` and `sudo` are available, the installer tries to install `zsh tmux git curl ripgrep fzf neovim`.
- If the host is already root, it uses `apt-get` directly.
- If `sudo` is unavailable, it skips system packages and still tries user-level Rust and `cargo install yazi-fm`.
- `50-linux-remote.zsh` only loads Linux-only logic behind guards, including optional `nvm`, optional `$HOME/.local/bin/env`, a minimal welcome banner, and safe Linux tool exports.

## Re-running safely

`./install.sh` is intended to be safe to rerun.

- Existing correct symlinks are skipped.
- Existing non-matching files or links are moved to `~/.dotfile-backups/<timestamp>/` before new links are created.
- No target is overwritten silently.
- Missing optional installers produce warnings instead of aborting the whole run.

## After editing the repo

For shell changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

For tmux changes, reload with:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

For Neovim and Yazi, restart the application. On first Neovim startup, LazyVim may need network access to fetch plugins pinned in `lazy-lock.json`.

## FAQ

### Default shell did not change

If `chsh` failed or requires privileges, run:

```bash
chsh -s "$(command -v zsh)"
```

Then log out and back in. Some remote environments also require the target shell to be listed in `/etc/shells`.

### Remote host does not have zsh

Re-run `./install.sh`. If package installation still fails, install `zsh` with the system package manager manually, then run the script again.

### Linux host has no sudo

The installer will still set up symlinks, try to install Rust with `rustup`, and install `yazi-fm` with Cargo if possible. For `zsh`, `tmux`, `git`, `curl`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`, and `neovim`, install them manually or ask an administrator to do so.

### Neovim fails on first launch

The bundled config uses LazyVim and `lazy.nvim`. First launch may need internet access to clone plugin sources before the lockfile can be applied locally.

### Yazi cannot open files in Neovim

This repo uses `nvim %s` as the editor opener so the same config works on macOS and Linux. If `nvim` is not on `PATH`, install Neovim or add the correct path in your private local zsh file.
